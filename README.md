# Pose Detection Web App

## Overview
This project is a web application for detecting human poses in real-time using webcam input or uploaded video files. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for pose estimation and OpenCV for image processing. The app provides visual feedback on the correctness of poses, including facing direction, accuracy percentage, and specific feedback on angles.

## Features
- Real-time pose detection using webcam.
- Upload video files for pose analysis.
- Visual feedback with colored landmarks (green for correct, red for incorrect).
- Display of the facing direction (front, left, right).
- Accuracy percentage and feedback on angles.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, create a `requirements.txt` file and use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   (Replace `app.py` with the name of your main Python file if different.)

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the application.

## Usage Instructions
1. **CSV File Selection**: Select a CSV file containing the ideal angles for different poses.
2. **Input Method**: Choose whether to upload a video or use the webcam.
3. **Visual Feedback**: The application will display the detected pose, facing direction, accuracy percentage, and feedback on the angles.
